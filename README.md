Nifty50 Price Prediction using scikit-learn
This project aims to predict the price of the Nifty50 index using machine learning techniques implemented in Python. The prediction model is built using scikit-learn library, which provides a wide range of machine learning algorithms and tools.

Introduction
The Nifty50 Price Prediction project utilizes historical data of the Nifty50 index to train a machine learning model that can predict the future prices. This can be useful for investors, traders, and financial analysts to make informed decisions.

The project is implemented in Python 3.8+ and utilizes several Python packages, including pandas, yfinance, and scikit-learn. The Nifty50 dataset is downloaded during the project using the yfinance package, and the scikit-learn library is used for building and evaluating the prediction model.

Usage
Open the nifty50_price_prediction.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to execute each code cell.
Run the notebook cells to perform data downloading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Modify or experiment with the code to customize the model or try different algorithms.
Use the trained model to make price predictions for the Nifty50 index.

Dataset
The project uses the yfinance package to download historical data of the Nifty50 index. The dataset consists of daily stock prices and other relevant features.

Model Training
The project includes code for training a machine learning model to predict the Nifty50 index price. The nifty50_price_prediction.ipynb notebook provides step-by-step instructions to download the dataset, preprocess it, split it into training and testing sets, and train the model using scikit-learn.

Different machine learning algorithms are available in scikit-learn, such as linear regression, support vector regression, and random forest regression. You can experiment with different algorithms and parameters to find the best model for price prediction.

Model Evaluation
After training the model, it is evaluated using various metrics to assess its performance. The notebook includes code to calculate metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and coefficient of determination (R-squared). These metrics help in understanding how well the model predicts the Nifty50 index price.
